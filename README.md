# garden-website
Source code for http://garden.gis.vt.edu website, shared for the benefit of other GARDEN members.

This site contains 4 HTML pages, a css/ directory an images/ directory and an includes/ directory.
The pages have the .php file extension because some of them use a common navigation element from the includes/ directory.
It would be possible to refactor the pages to be purely static HTML if you cannot run PHP in your environment.

To adapt this site to other Virginia GARDEN nodes, it will be necessary to, at minimum:

1.  Replace references to "Virginia Tech" with your institution.
2.  Replace references to "Enterprise GIS" and "EGIS" with your unit.
3.  Replace references to "http://www.gis.vt.edu/*" and "http://www.vt.edu/*" with appropriate URLS for your unit.
4.  Update all contact information (phone numbers, mailing addresses, e-mail addresses)
5.  Replace images/garden-header.png with your own header image.

Other customization (branding, CSS colors, additional content pages) is entirely at your discretion, but is encouraged.
